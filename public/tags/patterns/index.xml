      <description>Bishop and knight normally coordinate poorly in chess. They trip around each other awkwardly, the bishop only controlling squares of one colour, while the fickle knight hops between light and dark squares with each move.
Yet in atomic chess, they can combine harmoniously in a particular tactical sequence that crops up now and then. The knight and bishop invade the opponent&amp;rsquo;s camp to catch the king in a forced mate. Despite the specific circumstances needed for this tactic, the sequence felt common enough that I decided to share it with you.</description>

      <description>Pawns have long given me trouble in atomic chess. They don&amp;rsquo;t seem to obey the same rules as their normal chess counterparts: no doubling, controlling space differently, isolation not being a weakness. Worse still, calculating pawn moves and captures in endgames had usually left me completely confused and overlooking moves. The brute force approach to evaluating each pawn move on its own was a straight road to time trouble and blunders, letting opponents escape with draws or even wins.</description>
