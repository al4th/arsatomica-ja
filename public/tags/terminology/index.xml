      <description>There is much to learn from the study of chess and chess-like games in Asia. Two useful terms we can borrow from their literature are sente and gote, which relate to the concept of the initiative.
Sente (pronounced sen-teh, 先手) and gote (go-teh, 後手) are terms frequently encountered when studying the Japanese games of go and shogi. I find that they are clearer and more focused terms than &amp;ldquo;the initiative&amp;rdquo; that we have in chess.</description>
