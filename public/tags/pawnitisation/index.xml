      <description>This week is just a quick update with the solution to last week&amp;rsquo;s problems. How well did you do?
The first position wasn&amp;rsquo;t hard insofar as calculations go, but relies more on the ability to see the long winning plan. In particular, one needs to realise that the white king must get out of the corner without letting black out. After seeing that and taking care of a few small tactical details, &amp;ldquo;the rest is just technique&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Last week I discussed the fundamentals of pawnitisation - make your opponent&amp;rsquo;s bishop useless by putting your pawns on the opposite colour. It lets you draw if you&amp;rsquo;re down a bishop, provided all your pawns can&amp;rsquo;t be attacked by the bishop, and there are no passed pawns. Simple.
But of course, chess is rarely that simple. This week we&amp;rsquo;ll be looking at the exceptions - where white can win even when there are no pawn majorities and no targets for the bishop.</description>

      <title>Pawnitisation - the bad bishop</title>

      <description>Only half the chessboard is ever available to a bishop, the other half forever off-limits. The poor bishop vacillates between its allowed squares, while the enemy pieces taunt it, safely out of reach on the opposite-coloured squares. It is free, unopposed, but with no purpose or function.
When you&amp;rsquo;re up just a bishop that has literally nothing to attack, its existence is almost irrelevant to the position.
What is &amp;ldquo;pawnitisation&amp;rdquo;? Pawnitisation is an endgame defence against such a bad bishop.</description>
